# What is The Firearm Education Project?
This project is a data-driven exploration to gain a better understanding of firearm related incidents and deaths in the United States. Public perception is frequently shaped by 
news reports and breaking news headlines, and without unbiased  resources at hand, this can cause misunderstaning and fear. The goal of this project is to present the facts and foster
informed discussions that can enhance public education and safety, hopefully reducing the number of firearm related deaths.
# Key Questions
This project will study the leading cause of death in all age groups [by firearms], what age group (if any) are most affected by the leading cause, and if there is a correlation 
in a state's total population and the total number of reported deaths.
# Data Sources
Dataset 1, US Census Estimated Population by State, Year, Gender, and Age Group (2009 to 2017)
Dataset 2, US CDC Underlying Cause of Death in Population due to Firearms by State, Year, Gender, and Age Group

# About the Code Creator
This was a project of my choosing as part of my final for the Career Foundry Data Analysis certification program. I chose this project specifially because of it's challeneges and the 
opportunity to present an unbiased view at deaths related to firearms. 
This project contains the following folders: 01 Project Management (word doc, FE Data Summary 
and word doc, FE Project Brief). 02 Data (Data Collection folder (original dataset and collection 
methods), Original Data (original data sets used in Python), and Prepared Data (datasets I cleaned
in Python and used for my analysis in Jupyter)). 03 Scripts (all Jupyter Scripts labled in the order 
in which I conducted various analysis and visualzation creations). 04 Visulizations (all visulizations
created for this project, though not all of them were used in the final report). 05 Sent to Client
(excel file detailing all datasets, including original and final copy, as well as all changes 
I made and some additinonal visulizations/recommendations).
